# SegBo: A Database of Borrowed Sounds in the World's Languages

SegBo is the first large-scale cross-linguistic database of borrowed phonological segments. It is a work in progress by:

- [Eitan Grossman](https://en.linguistics.huji.ac.il/people/eitan-grossman) (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- [Elad Eisen](https://en.linguistics.huji.ac.il/people/elad-eisen) (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem)
- [Dmitry Nikolaev](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/dmni1849-1.465312) (Stockholm University)
- [Steven Moran](https://www.unine.ch/evolang/home/team/steven-moran.html) (University of Neuchâtel)

SegBo data are availble in the [Cross-Linguistic Data Format](https://cldf.clld.org) here:

This data format integrates [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org) metadata about the languages in the SegBo sample.

Several articles using SegBo are in the works, and we are working on setting up a website to make the data accessible via a GUI, so stay tuned.
